# EOD GitHub Contribution Tracker

This tool generates a summary of GitHub contributions made by specified users or to specified repositories. It's designed to create an end-of-day report showing what commits were made during the day.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixed Issues

The updated version fixes several issues with the original script:

1. **Improved Token Handling**: Better feedback when token has insufficient permissions
2. **Date Flexibility**: Can check contributions for specific dates or previous days
3. **Better Repository Detection**: Falls back to explicitly defined repositories when API access fails
4. **More Robust User Tracking**: Checks both commit author names and GitHub usernames
5. **Enhanced Error Handling and Diagnostics**: More helpful error messages and debugging options
6. **Multi-Branch Support**: Fetches commits from all recently committed branches, not just the main branch
7. **WhatsApp Integration**: Automatically sends EOD summaries to WhatsApp after the daily run, with support for multi-part messages for long summaries

## üöÄ Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` or `pnpm install` to install dependencies
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your GitHub token and other settings
4. Build with `npm run build` or `pnpm run build`
5. Run with `npm run start` or `pnpm run start`
